# 🍃 Snowy Mint! 🍃

Welcome to my NixOS + Home-Manager config.
Through flakes, I keep two separate configs,
one for my nvidia desktop and another for my intel laptop.
I share common modules between them.
They are contained in the modules/ folder.

Please note that this configuration is still very tailored to *me*,
you need to be aware of needed username and direcotry changes.

I hope you enjoy.
